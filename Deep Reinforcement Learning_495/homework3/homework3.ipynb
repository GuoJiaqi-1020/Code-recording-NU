    "Consider the following situation. You start with a thousand dollars to invest in two different stocks, **Apple** or **Microsoft**, for 100 days. At the beginning of each day, you must pick a stock to invest in. At the end of each day, you observe the return, and decide which stock to invest in the next day. You don’t know what the return will be the next day, but you know that the return (as a proportion) of **Apple** is normally distributed with $\\mu = 0.05$ and $\\sigma^2 = 0.1$. The return of **Microsoft** is normally distributed with $\\mu = 0.1$ and $\\sigma^2 = 0.3$\n",
